SQL Server will use two types of operating system files
Data Files and Log Files
Data Files = .MDF
Log Files = .LDF

- Data Files can be two Types 

1. Primary Data Files
2. Secondary Data Files

-- Primary Data file is mandatory for any SQL Server Database
Reference :

he Primary data file contains startup information for the database and points to other files in the database. 
User data and objects can be stored in this file and every database has one primary data file

Secondary Data File is optional and it is used to spread the data across the multiple disks.

SQL Server can have multiple Data and Log files but only one Primary Data File

Above to these files, there is File Groups in which Data files and Log files are mapped to.

File Group is an Logical Container for Data Files. It can contain multiple Data Files.



Data stored in to Pages by SQL Server.

1 Byte (B) = 8 bits (b)
1 KB = 1024 Bytes
8 KB = 1 Page
8 Continuos pages = 1 Extent

/*
It is important to know that bytes are abbreviated with a capital B, where as bits use a lowercase b. 
Therefore, Mbps is megabits per second, and MBps is megabytes per second. So 8Mbps is equal to 1MBps.
*/

Note: If multiple data files are present in File Group, SQL Server allocates pages for data in all Data Files based on Round Robin Mechanism.

SQL Server also used proportion Fill algorithm to fill all the data files in sync and ensuring the data in all files reaches 100% at same time.

--To see the extents used 

DBCC showfilestats

--To see the space occupied 

Select DB_NAME() AS [DatabaseName], Name, file_id, physical_name,
    (size * 8.0/1024) as Size,
    ((size * 8.0/1024) - (FILEPROPERTY(name, 'SpaceUsed') * 8.0/1024)) As FreeSpace
    From sys.database_files
    
  Note: Primary Data will have by default more extents used though no object is created yet. Because it contains user information and Startup Information.
  
  
  
Note:  GO 10000  specifying any number after GO command is running the batch command for number of times.


-- to see where the data is stored on file or pages in a table.

DBCC IND ('Manvendra', 'Test_data1', -1);

DBCC IND ('DB NAME', 'TABLE NAME', -1);

Note: Whenever we insert the data in to table, if there are secondary data files, the data is soted in secondary data files is equal. this is because of Proportion Fill algorithm.
