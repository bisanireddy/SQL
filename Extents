There are 2 types of extents – mixed extent which stores data pages belong to the different objects and uniform extent which stores data pages belong to the one object. 

 First 8 pages for the objects are stored in the mixed extents, after that only uniform extents are used. 
 
 All space allocation  is done based on extents – 64K blocks regardless of the type (mixed or uniform).
 
 
 There are some Special Data pages using to track extents allocation. 
 
 These pages are basically bitmaps.

every bit handles one extent. So one page can cover 64,000 extents or almost 4Gb of data.

Let’s take a quick look at them:

GAM – Global Allocation Map – tracks if extent are available for allocation or already in use.
SGAM – Shared Global Allocation Map – tracks if extents are mixed extent and have at least one data page available for use.
IAM – Index Allocation Map – tracks if extents are used by specific table/index.
 
There are another special page type like PFS – Page Free Space

PFS – Page Free Space – tracks approximate amount of the free space in the page, as well as a few other things. One PFS page covers 8,088 pages or about 64Mb of data.
