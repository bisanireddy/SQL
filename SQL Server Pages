This section explains the structure of Page used in SQL Server whill will help you to understand the data writing.

There are different types of pages in SQL Server.

1. Data Page
2. Index Page
3. System Page
etc.

All pages are always with fixed size of 8KB.

Lets focus on Data Page
Data Page:

A data page always consists of 3 parts:

Page Header
Payload
Row Offset Array

Page Size = 8KB
8KB = 8192 Bytes

Page Header:
The page header is always 96 Bytes long in SQL Server (independent of the type of the page), 
and stores general information like the Page ID, Object ID, etc.

Note: Page header uses 96 Bytes of 8192 Bytes and it is fixed.

PayLoad:
Most important and interesting area as our data stores in this area.

Note: Payload will have 8096 Bytes allocated by SQL Server for data storing.
