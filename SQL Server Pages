This section explains the structure of Page used in SQL Server whill will help you to understand the data writing.

There are different types of pages in SQL Server.

1. Data Page
2. Index Page
3. System Page
etc.

All pages are always with fixed size of 8KB.

Lets focus on Data Page
Data Page:

A data page always consists of 3 parts:

Page Header
Payload
Row Offset Array

Page Size = 8KB
8KB = 8192 Bytes

Page Header:
The page header is always 96 Bytes long in SQL Server (independent of the type of the page), 
and stores general information like the Page ID, Object ID, etc.

Note: Page header uses 96 Bytes of 8192 Bytes and it is fixed.

PayLoad:
Most important and interesting area as our data stores in this area.

Note: Payload will have 8096 Bytes allocated by SQL Server for data storing.



Most Imp:

 SQL Server isnâ€™t able to read a part of a page from your storage, or write part of a page out to your storage.
 I/O operations are always done (at least) on a page level.
 
 So, all the WRITE Operations should be in a single shot and Read operations in single shot. 
 
 So, GOAL should be always to use the page as much as possible to write the data in to a single page.
 
 Row Offset Array:
 
 It stores 2 Bytes for every record on the page with a pointer where the record is located on the page.
 
 
 
 ----- for each page there is an internal over head of 7 at least.
 
 
 Reference :
 
 https://www.sqlpassion.at/archive/2016/08/22/data-pages-the-foundation-of-sql-server/
 
 
 Data pages are always belongs to one Database object and cannot be shared among two or more objects.
 
 Example.
 
 CREATE TABLE Customers
(
   FirstName CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   LastName CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   Address CHAR(100) NOT NULL,
   ZipCode CHAR(5) NOT NULL,
   Rating INT NOT NULL,
   ModifiedDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
)
GO


CHAR = Allocated Size
INT = 4
DATETIME = 8

Total space for an row for the above table.

 The size of a record is here 224 bytes long (50 + 50 + 100 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 7).   
 Note: 7 bytes of over head for each row must be calculated.
 
 total space for payload = 8096
one row space = 224

total rows = 8096/224 = 36.14 = 36 rows

Space remaining = 8096 - 36*224 = 32 Bytes - This space is wasted and is not used.


Another Example:

If database object defined in way it occupies 4031 Bytes, then 4029 Bytes are wasted.


Note: If a VARCHAR is defined in table definition, then these columns are stored on a different page.




Space Wasted on Object Level :

sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors

SELECT
   DB_NAME(database_id), 
   SUM(free_space_in_bytes) / 1024 AS 'Free_KB'
FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors
WHERE database_id <> 32767
GROUP BY database_id
ORDER BY SUM(free_space_in_bytes) DESC
GO
